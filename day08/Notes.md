This day challenge was really tough and I believe I start to reach the end of what I am capable of solving without too much trouble.
The 1st part of the challenge was quite easy in my opinion.
However the second part was extremely difficult and it took me several attempts to get it right.
First, I don't beleive that I would have been able to answer the second part without looking for guidance on the sub-reddit.
Second, I don't understand how the people solving this case have found out about the "LCM solution", I beleive that one guy found it, spread it online and other people followed it, I just can't wrap my head around the fact that there is a guys that noticed that the solution was based on a LCM.
I initially made a loop checking for all solutions possible and tried to brute force the solution of Day 2. After 24 hours running on the server, and more than a billion loops done, I terminated the script and looked for another solution (FYI, the answer on my dataset was 109 trillion, 215 billion, 479 million, 909 thousand, and 230... so good luck to brute force that with for loops).
